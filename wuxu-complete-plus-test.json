  "description" : "Welcome to WuXu’s Library++!\n\nThis source contains all your favourite tweaked apps, free streaming, cracked apps, and more!\n\nThis highly organised AltSource is made up of many different tweaked apps that I, myself, inject each and every deb/dylib (tweak) into. While making sure everything is working perfectly and to my standards.\n\nThis source is updated 2-3 times a week, or more depending on the urgency. But I am working on automating updates through a python bot which I am close to completing.\n\nIf you enjoy my source please spread the word, this is essentially an updated QuarkSources, and I would like it to be as big, if not, bigger!\n\nTo make requests, get support or chat with other users, join the discord server! https://discord.gg/nKXsSdbEDc\n\nWuXu’s Sources Official Website: https://wuxu1.github.io/",

      "localizedDescription" : "From the dev:\n\n• YouTube really messed up with OLED dark mode in v18.15.1+. We should stay on the lower version for now.\n• For those who're using the pre-release version (v18.15.1-3.0): I strongly recommend you downgrade from v18.15.1-3.0 to v18.14.1-3.0 (this version).\n• Guess my journey with uYouPlus will end here. The app will be updated by other developers. This is probably the last time I - qnblackcat, update uYouPlus. Enjoy!\n\n\nIf you're a YouTube app user then you'll have to take advantage of uYou tweak.\n\nWith uYou, you can enjoy video and audio downloads with importing features, play videos in PiP (Picture In Picture), background audio playback, and a whole lot of other features that are usually restricted/not available in the YouTube app.\n\nuYou will add an icon button on the top right corner (beside the search icon) to show the Downloads/Downloading list.\nYou can also access uYou's settings from the Downloads list.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Remove YouTube Ads.\n• Background playback for YT videos.\n• Download Videos/Audio/Shorts for offline playback (supports up to 4K).\n• Support all YT Formats (MP4 + WebM), all qualities (from 144p to 4K) and all frames (30fps, 50fps, and 60fps).\n• Play saved media in a custom player with background playback support.\n• Supports mini-player for easier navigation.\n• Supports scrubbing/controls from Control Center.\n• Share/Export saved videos to Camera Roll or to any other app.\n• Gestures Controls on Video (Swipe Left/Right to increase/decrease Volume/Brightness/Seek).\n• Playback Speed Controls.\n• Play videos in PiP (Picture In Picture).\n• iPad layout style.\n• Sideloaded iPA.\n• In-app Settings.\n• Support Cercube and DLEasy migration to move all of your downloads into uYou with a tap of a button.\n• More options are in the settings.",
